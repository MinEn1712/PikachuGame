Matching Game (a.k.a Pikachu Game)

The objective of this project is to create a matching game (matching 2 of the same blocks).
Requirements: the path from block A to block B must be I or U or Z or L shaped.
In this project we using BFS algorithm to find the shortest and yet valid path from one block to another.
My main task in this project is to render and create UI for the game.
